# Objective

Build a multiplayer game of tic tac toe.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical:
- Must use React and React best practices to the best of your ability.
- No server interaction is required.
- Typescript is not required, but is a bonus.

### Gameplay:
- Must have the ability to support 2 players, playing on the same machine side by side.
- Input form taking player names is not required, but is a bonus. Otherwise, just “Player 1” and “Player 2” is sufficient.
- Must render a game board at the start of the game.
- Clicking on a tile should place an X or an O on the tile depending on the current player's turn.
- It must display the winner at the end of the game.
- The game should prevent placing a piece on a tile that another player has already selected.

### Bonus:
- Highlight the win condition on the board in some way.
- Display which player has won.
- Input form allowing players to input their names.
- Ability to restart a game after completing one.
- Score counter for each player's total wins.
- Being professionally/beautifully styled is not required, but minimally it should have at least rudimentary styling.
    - It does not matter how you style, but you will be asked to justify your choice of technology against other possible options and why you chose it.

## Technical guidance
- You are free to use whatever third-party libraries you want.
- You are free to arrange your project structure in any way that you’d like, but you will be asked to justify your choice against other possible options.
- You are free to include TypeScript if you choose.
- You are free to use any styling practices you’d like but you will be asked to justify your choice against other possible options.
- When architecting your game, you know that in your next iteration, you may have to extend your code to build Connect 4 and you want to make the code as re-usable and extendable as possible.
- To get started:
    - Create a new folder to host your assignment.
    - Scaffold a new project using Vite following this guide: [Vite Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
